QtEffects
---------

What a cute name :)

A tiny C++/Qt4 library to make small graphic effects on widgets.
It does not do anything really new, it's more helper classes to use standard
QTimeLine.

A commented example application in example/

Compilation & integration
---------------------------

Classic Qt library, see the example in example/.

Hint::

    qmake
    make

Usage
------

See example in example/

TODO
----

1. Stop lying, the example is not documented neither is the code. Do something.

2. Naming of classes is unfortunate. Do something.

3. The effect should be a QObject and belong to the target widget hierarchy, so
it will be automatically deleted when when the target widget gets deleted.

4. Support other roles than background.
